# Test Program
 This program is a replica of the 1980's classic arcade
 game, Pac-man. The purpose of recreating this game is
 to get used to using my own engine and to understand
 which parts of the engine "missed the mark," so to speak.
 
 Depending on when you come across this program, the game
 may seem barren or close to completion.

# Controls
 WASD - Move Pac-man around the screen.

 Enter - Pause/unpause the game.
