	This game is a replica of the classic 1980 arcade game pac-man.
	The purpose of this project is to attempt to re-build pac-man
	in my own game engine to test the engine's usability and to get used
	to building games in my own engine.

	If you are from Bandai-Namco and do not want a recreation of your
	property on githuib please contact me @ crosenau@sfu.ca.
	However, please consider that this project is for learning
	purposes and is not for profit.
