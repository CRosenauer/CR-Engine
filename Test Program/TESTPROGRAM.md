# Test Program
 This is a simple program used to test entity handling,
 music and sfx handling, and video rendering. Please
 note that I have removed certain filed from the Resources
 file as in testing I used copywritten files and do not
 want to create any legal trouble.
 
 The sprite on screen may not appear to be moving, however
 the frame rate is currently uncapped so the sprite is just
 moving very fast.

# Controls
 Enter - Quit the program
 
 Note: input reading is currently
 inelegant and may require several presses to quit the
 program.

# Files to Include
 To properly use this test program add a file named
 "Fryday Chinatown.mp3" and "shine.wav" to the path
 "Resources/Audio".
