# Test Program
 This is a simple program used to test several components
 of the CR-Engine. Please note that I have removed certain
 filed from the Resources file as in testing I used 
 copywritten files and do not want to create any legal 
 trouble.
 
 It may seem as if the ship is bound to the center portion
 of the screen, and you would be correct to a certain extent.
 However, the ship is moving relative to global game co-ordinates
 but the viewport is also moving relative to global game co-ordinates
 which results in the ship not moving relative to the viewport.

# Controls
 WASD - Move the ship around the screen.

 Enter - Quit the program

# Files to Include
 To properly use this test program add files named
 "Fryday Chinatown.mp3" and "shine.wav" to the path
 "Resources/Audio".
