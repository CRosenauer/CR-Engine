# Test Program
 This is a simple program used to test several components
 of the CR-Engine. Please note that I have removed certain
 filed from the Resources file as in testing I used 
 copywritten files and do not want to create any legal 
 trouble.

# Controls
 WASD - Move the ship around the screen.

 Enter - Quit the program

# Files to Include
 To properly use this test program add a file named
 "Fryday Chinatown.mp3" and to the path
 "Resources/Audio".
