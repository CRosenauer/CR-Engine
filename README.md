# CR-Engine (WIP)
 A simple game engine developed in C++ build off of SDL.
 
 Note this project has been discontinued. To see the
 conclusion and short coming of the CR-Engine see

# Overview
 The CR-Engine is a simple C++ game engine build off of SDL
 which contains "relatively" simple ways to handle game
 objects, draw sprites to a screen, play sound effects and
 music, and interpret user inputs. It should be noted that
 this project is a very early work in progress, as such it
 is subject to change as I further develop it and learn
 from my mistakes. Additionally, no documentation is
 currently avaliable for the engine; however, documentation
 will be included in a later stage when more progress has
 been made and design choices have been finalized.
 
 If you are considering using this engine for a game
 development project of your own, don't. There are
 currently better free engines for game development that
 more robust and easier to work with than the CR-Engine.
 
# Purpose
 The purpose of the CR-Engine is to practice my C++
 knowledge in a field that I have some degree of interest
 in, game development. Additionally, I wanted to test how
 large of a project I could effectively build using C++.
 
 As for more specific goals of this project, the CR-Engine
 aims to be a reusable platform for handling game objects,
 user inputs, 2D sprite rendering, and audio feedback.
 
 Much of the work in this project will be amatuer,
 functional but amatuer none the less. As such if you find
 this project and feel so inclined to critique my work any
 and all feedback is apriciated.
